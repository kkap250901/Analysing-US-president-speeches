I am submitting 4 files:

First file being the US president-speeches-with-metadata-test. This consists of the us president speeches, summaries, titles and 
the president name as well as their associated party

Second file is the Collecing-data.py which has the code I used to scrape the speech transcripts, summaries, dates and
president partty affliation from wiki data

Third file is US_President_Speeches_Bayes.ipynb this runs the EDA part of the reportt where I analyse the most frequent bigrams and 
trigrams used by republicans vs democrats in the globalisation period

Fourth file is the Analysis.ipynb file which has all the cleaning, topic modelling, word embedding and analysis for the report
